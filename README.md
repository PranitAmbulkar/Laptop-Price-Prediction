# Laptop-Price-Prediction
Prediction of laptop Prices by entering its features 
## Overview

This project aims to predict laptop prices using various machine learning models. The project utilizes a dataset comprising laptop specifications and prices sourced from online marketplaces and retailers. Different regression algorithms are trained and evaluated to predict laptop prices based on features such as brand, processor type, RAM, storage, screen size, GPU, and operating system.
